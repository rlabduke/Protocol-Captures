beta server is altmolprobity on muscle
main MolProbity is on mental

ssh to mental or muscle as rlab (or use "su rlab" while there)

~rlab/Desktop/MolProbities holds all versions of MP that have been installed
MolProbity symlinks to the current version

NEW_SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS records the commands to stop apache, update the symlink, then restart apache for major version changes


example:
molprobity_4.2 is the scientifically complete version of 4.2, what we share with people who want to set up their own servers
molprobity_4.2_live is the version we actually serve, where changes to banners and announcements can change and be logged.

-----------------------

git branch molprobity_versionnumber
git branch molprobity_versionnumber_live

*versionnumber is the reference version
*live is the version actually served - changes to banners and such go here

remember to push --set-upstream origin the new branches so that GitHub knows about them (git will give you this command when your first attempt to git push a new branch fails)

this is set up so that we cherry-pick changes, which should deter us from making changes without reversioning, and so that we don't merge to 4.2 from master
--

ssh rlab@mental
cd Desktop/Molprobities
this contains all versions of MP, including a symlink that is what the server serves
git clone the repository
checkout the live branch so that we serve the thing we mean to

run configure
if configure doesn't work, probably just nuke the dir and start over
run setup (may not be necessary)

run tests
diff test results on new and old versions

cat NEW_SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS
do what they say
short version:
stop apache
redo the simlinks
restart apache

clean out old temp data
from data/tmp, rm tmp_*
from data, rm -r *9* (try a few different numbers and it should clean everything but tmp)

copy config.php from previous server (this is not tracked by git because it contains email information for bug reports)

notes on cherrypicking

cherrypicking takes the changes from a particular commit and records them as a new commit somewhere else.

Make a change in master
cherrypick to MolProbity#
merge MolProbity# to MolProbity#Live
push everything
git pull on the live server

google how to cherrypick a commit

git cherrypick longcommitidentity -e
(-e will let us edit the commit message, -m and a new message also fine)
