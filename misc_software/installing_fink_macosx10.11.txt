Installing Fink for Mac OSX 10.11

These instructions are derived from http://www.finkproject.org/download/srcdist.php as of late May 2016.

Should you install Fink?
-------
You probably have a version of Fink already.  If you have a /sw directory, you have a Fink.  Look in /sw/fink to check for version numbers.  If you don't have a 10.11 in there, you probably want to update.

(Older versions of Fink look for older versions of perl on your machine.  If Fink can't find a version of perl it likes, it's not going to work.)

You probably should install a new version of Fink.
-------


Prepare your machine
-------
Install xcode developer tools
COMMAND: xcode-select --install
(You may already have these.  This command is still safe in that case.)
You may also need to run
COMMAND: sudo xcodebuild -license

Move or remove old version of Fink
COMMAND: mv /sw /sw_old
-------


Download Fink source
-------
Go to http://www.finkproject.org/download/srcdist.php
Download source code for your OS
Unzip/untar the download
-------


Installing Fink
-------
Navigate to the Fink source code directory.
COMMAND: ./bootstrap
This command will install Fink to /sw

Fink will ask you a bunch of questions during the install.  The defaults seems to be fine, so you can just hit return each time to accept the defaults.

To source the Fink environment,
COMMAND: . /sw/bin/init.sh

If you want the Fink env sourced automatically when you open a terminal:
COMMAND: /sw/bin/pathsetup.sh
This will update your .bashprofile or similar

You will also need to update Fink.
-------


Update Fink
-------
Ensure the Fink environment is sourced.
COMMAND: fink selfupdate-rsync
COMMAND: fink index -f

These commands must be run even after an install of the current source code.
If Fink is unable to find a package that you know should exist, run this update to make sure that Fink is looking in the right places to find the package.
