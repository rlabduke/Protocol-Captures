Installing Pymol for Mac OSX 10.11

This is a guide to installing pymol from its freely-available source code

Dependencies: xcode developer tools
-------
Pymol has several dependencies that are included in the xcode developer tools.
You will also need the dev tools to install Fink.

Install xcode developer tools
COMMAND: xcode-select --install
(You may already have these.  This command is still safe in that case.)
You may also need to run
COMMAND: sudo xcodebuild -license
-------

Dependencies: Fink
-------
Pymol needs a Fink version of python and the pmw dependency is easily acquired through Fink.

Follow the directions at http://www.finkproject.org/download/srcdist.php
or
see separate installing_fink_macosx10.11 document for details

Source the Fink environment
COMMAND: fink install python
COMMAND: fink install pmw

If Fink cannot find these packages, run
COMMAND: fink selfupdate-rsync
COMMAND: fink index -f
to update where Fink looks for packages
-------


Dependencies: glew
-------
Go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/glew/?source=typ_redirect
Download source code for glew
Unzip/untar the download
Navigate to the glew download directory

glew will try to install to a location (/usr) used by previous version of the Mac OS, but which is not used for installs in the current version.  You need to edit the makefile to reflect Mac's new preferred install location (/usr/local).

Open the makefile in your preferred editor.
Find these lines near the beginning of the file:
GLEW_PREFIX ?= /usr
GLEW_DEST ?= /usr

Change these lines to:
GLEW_PREFIX ?= /usr/local
GLEW_DEST ?= /usr/local

Save your changes.  Now you can install glew.

COMMAND: make
COMMAND: sudo -s
COMMAND: make install
COMMAND: make clean

(The make install command will fail if the makefile has not been changed to target /usr/local)

Installing pymol
-------
Go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/pymol/
Download source code for pymol
Unzip/untar the download
Navigate to the pymol download directory

COMMAND: /sw/bin/python2.7 setup.py build install --home=~
(pymol will be installed to ~/bin with this command. If you want it in another_directory/bin, use --home=another_directory)
(/sw/bin/python2.7 is the python associated with Fink. Adjust this path if you didn't put Fink in /sw)

Marvel at how easy that was relative to setting up the dependencies.

Launching pymol

COMMAND: ~/bin/pymol
